# HTML to PDF Generation Tool with Puppeteer

This tool is built with Node.js and utilizes Puppeteer to generate PDFs from HTML pages. It works well and generates PDFs that are identical to those generated by Chrome's print dialog. It eliminates the headache of dealing with inconsistent PDF libraries while rendering HTML.

## Installation

To install this tool, simply run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Docker container that contains the tool.

## Usage

To use the tool, make a GET request to the `/topdf` endpoint with the URL of the page you want to generate a PDF from. For example:

```
http://localhost:3000/topdf?url=https://example.com
```

The tool will generate a PDF from the provided URL and return it in the response. You can then save the PDF or display it in the browser as needed.

Note that the tool requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the [Docker website â†—](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
